    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <img src="images/Mo.jpg" alt="My Picture">

    <p>My name is <i>Moksham Sharma</i>. I was born in Barnala, Punjab, India on August 13th 1999. 
        Barnala is a city in Punjab which is known for its: 
        <ul>
            <li>Textile market</li>
            <li>Polished woodwork jewelry </li>
            <li>Traditional jewelry</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <p>As a baby, I was always attracted to shiny/reflective things like a bulb, wrist watch, fancy wrist bands etc.
         My parents would describe me as an infant who loved eating literally anything, could fall asleep in under a minute, and could play
          for hours. 
         My favorite toy as a toddler was a remote-control car which was given to me by my grandparents for my birthday.
         I remember being it my favorite toy as
          I would play non-stop for hours till the battery would die and would go crying to my mother for help to fix it as I as a kid 
          didn’t know that it wasn’t broken.  </p>
    <p>As I grew older, sports became my hobby. The type of sport never mattered to me, it was always the fun, 
        play time with other kids around me that I used to look forward to every day.
         According to my mother, it was usually very difficult to convince me to get back home as I always wanted to play more. </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
         <p>I achieved my high school diploma from Ryan international school in 2017. After considering all my options after high school,
             me and my family decided that I was going to move to Canada to pursue my higher education.
             I went to the College of New Caledonia in Prince George and graduated with a web and graphic design diploma.
              This program made me realize that it’s the front/back end of the web that I am more interested in, than the graphic part of it. 
               I am currently a student of the web developer program at
               <b><a href="https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/certificates/web-developer"> SAIT</a></b>, Calgary. </p>
